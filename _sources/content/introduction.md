# Introduction

ModelFlow is a Python library developed to leverage on the Pandas data managegement library and the broader Python exosystem. So that models can be solved and models and results can be analyzed and vizualized. 

**Model Specification** With ModelFlow you can specify your models as concise and intuitive equations. ModelFlow transforms your equations into Python code and solves your model.

**Large models**.
ModelFlow can handle models with 1 million equations and more. The library is therefore also suited for very large models.

**Agile model development**
The models are specified at a high level of abstraction and are processed fast. This makes ModelFlow the obvious choice when developing and experimenting with large models.

**Onboarding models**.
Creating a model often entails recycling several models specified in different ways: Excel, Latex, Dynare, Python and other languages/tools.
ModelFlow, which is nested in the Python's ecosystem, makes it possible to transform models defined in many different languages into ModelFlow models.

**Onboarding data**.
ModelFlow is build on top of Pythons Pandas Library, which makes it easy to import and manage many different types of data.

**Analytic** ModelFlow provides you with a range of visual tools that help you understand your models and your results.

**Open Source**
Be part of the community. The entire library is written in Python and is to be found on our Github page. Adjust the tools to your needs or help develope the library even further.
